    <h4> Duplicate Question Caching </h4>
    <br>
    <p> The duplicate question caching system is intended to speed up the answering process for questions that 
        have already been answered. The site caches recent questions so that when a question is asked again, if it
        is a duplicate of a question that has already been asked, we fetch the answer from the cache and do not 
        need to query the neural network again.

        Traditionally duplicate question detection is done via a Siamese neural network, which uses two identical 
        neural networks with shared weights to compute the similarity and decide whether it has the potential to 
        be a duplicate. Though this approach has decent accuracy, it requires a neural network to encapsulate an 
        entire natural language question as a single finite-dimensional embedding, which is a daunting task.
        <br><br>
        In an effort to look for a better way to detect duplicate questions, I was inspired by the attention
        mechanism, and how it achieves much better performance than summarization with a single embedding by looking at 
        the entire sentence at once. Thus I developed a duplicate questions framework based on a Sequential Least Squares 
        Programming (SLSQP) solver.
        <br><img src="static/images/optimization.png" alt="Optimization" style="float: right; width:600px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px"><br>
        I couldn't use equality for SLSQP, had to bound the solution. Had to adapt entropy a tiny bit to return 0 for 0 inputs. Weights were 
        constrained to be greater than 0 and less than 1. There are some interesting side effects of this approach as well, such that when there
        is padding or an unknown word, the weights solved for are all 0, which intuitively means that these provide no information.
        <br><br>
        This model achieves 70% validation accuracy, with around 83% training accuracy, and does not outperform the Siamese network, but 
        this is to be expected. There are two main flaws with this approach, though there are clear paths to resolve them.
        <br><br>
        Firstly, there is no recognition of different words (two questions sharing "the" is equivalent them sharing "eucalyptus"), 
        and this could be mitigated by relying on tf-idf weighting or a similar mechanism to make rarer words in the corpus more "valuable". 
        Secondly, there the constrained optimization method is rather inexpressive as it relies on very simple relationships such 
        as weighted sums, and I feel like the use of a neural network in a similar context would have a lower bias.
