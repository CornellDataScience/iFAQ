    <h4 style="font-family:"Roboto", sans-serif;"><br> Candidate Retrieval </h4>
    <p style="font-family:"Roboto", sans-serif;">Considering huge amount text needed to be searched while finding the answer,
      we would like to first find possible paragraphs to narrow down the search area,
      which is so called the candidate retrieval. The document uploaded is first segmented in different paragraphs.
      Each paragraph would be encoded as bag of words. With the feature vectors representing paragraphs,
      we do spectral clustering with a rbf kernel on them. The resulting clusters are different topics we would like to retrieve.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:"Roboto", sans-serif;">For the retrieval process where we are given a question, we measure the L2 distance between the question and every paragraph.
      Take the paragraph closest to the question and retrieve the whole cluster that paragraph belongs to. That cluster of paragraphs would be our candidates for answering questions.

    <h4> Extractive Question Answering </h4>
    <p>The model we are using is called Reinforced Mnemonic Reader (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02798">Hu et al. 2018</a>). The architecture of the model is shown below</p>
    <img src="../static/images/m_reader.png" width=30% class='center' >
    <p>The key idea of the model is basically attending the context, which is the candidate paragraphs after our retrieval, with the question user asked.
    This attentive information is then combined with the context with a <a style="font-family:courier"> fusion </a> function to produce a question-attend context feature.
    This is then self attended to capture long term dependenciesamong context words. </p>
